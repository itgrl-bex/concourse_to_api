# Pipelines About

## About

This folder is where example pipelines and active pipelines should be stored. Documentation around the use and functionality of the pipelines will be housed with the examples.  It is suggested that documentation also be provided as a reference to your active pipelines as well.

## Active pipelines

So that you can keep reference examples and your active pipelines in the same repo without confusion, the directory `pipelines/active` is where the active copy of your pipelines should be. Document your pipeline in this [README](pipelines/active/README.md).

## Pipeline examples

The directory structure is setup to be able to house pipeline examples for multiple technologies.
At the time of this release, concourse is the only example that has been provided.

### Concourse

This directory houses the example concourse pipelines.  
For more information see [Concourse Pipelines](pipelines/examples/concourse/CONCOURSEPIPELINES.md)

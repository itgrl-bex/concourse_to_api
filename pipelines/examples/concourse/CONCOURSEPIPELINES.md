# Concourse Pipelines

This directory is to house example pipelines for reference or use.

The directory `singleRepo` houses the examples if you are putting the data json files in the same repo as the code, aka this repo.

The directory `dataRepo` houses the examples if you are putting the data json files in a separate repo from the code, aka this repo.

The idea is that you would make a copy of the required example pipelines and place them in the `pipelines/active` folder.
